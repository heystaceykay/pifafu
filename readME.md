Hey! 
<br><br>I'm excited about creating websites and building mobile apps that can make the world a better place. 
<br><br>Technology has the ability to lower the barriers to entry for education and community, but only if we make accessibility a priority in our decisions. It's my belief that this is a worthy goal.
<br><br>I'm ready to expand my knowledge and apply it in new, dynamic ways.
